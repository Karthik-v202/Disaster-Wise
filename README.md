<h2 id="Problem-statement"></h2>
<h3>Natural disasters pose significant risks to human lives and properties, often leaving individuals unprepared for their impact. People moving to new locations or visiting unfamiliar areas lack knowledge about potential disasters and the necessary precautions to take. There is a need for an accessible, user-friendly platform that provides localized disaster predictions and preparedness guidelines to help individuals plan and respond effectively. This gap hinders disaster awareness and preparedness among communities, increasing vulnerability and potential losses during disasters.</h3>

<h2 id="Idea"></h2>
<h3>DisasterWise,is an interactive web-based platform that combines geospatial mapping and disaster prediction technology. Users can select any location on the map, and the platform will provide:  
- A list of potential disasters that could occur in that area (e.g., earthquakes, floods, wildfires).  
- Customized preparedness guidelines for each disaster type.  
- Recommendations for essential safety measures and resources.  
</h3>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>1. Interactive Map: A user-friendly map interface to select locations.  
2. Disaster Prediction:Insights based on historical data, geographical conditions, and predictive models.  
3. Preparedness Guidelines: Comprehensive steps to prepare for specific disasters.  
4. Targeted Use Cases: 
   - Tourists visiting disaster-prone areas.  
   - Individuals relocating to unfamiliar locations.</h3>
  
<h2>How the Idea Works</h2>
<h3>1. User Accesses the Platform:
   - The user visits the website and is greeted with an interactive map of the world.

    2. Location Selection:

   - The user selects a specific location by clicking on the map or entering the location name in a search bar.

    3. Data Analysis:

   - The platform analyzes the selected location using a combination of:
     - Historical Disaster Data: Past records of disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, hurricanes) that occurred in the area.
     - Geographical Data:Terrain, climate conditions, proximity to water bodies, fault lines, etc.
     - Predictive Algorithms:AI and statistical models to identify the likelihood of future disasters.

     4. Disaster Prediction Output:
   - The system displays a list of potential disasters (e.g., Flood Risk: High,Earthquake Risk: Moderate).

     5. Preparedness Guidelines: 
   - For each disaster, the platform provides:  
     - Precautionary Steps: Actions users can take to prepare (e.g. Stock up on emergency supplies,Identify evacuation routes).  
     - Emergency Contacts:Local disaster management authorities, shelters, and helplines.  
     - Resource Recommendations:Suggested items such as first aid kits, water filters, and survival tools.  

    <h3>6. Targeted Recommendations:</h3>  
   - For tourists: Tailored advice based on trip duration and local conditions.  
   - For new residents: Long-term preparation plans, such as securing homes against disasters.  

     7. User Engagement:
   - The platform can allow users to download preparation guides for offline use.  
   - Regular updates keep users informed of changing conditions (e.g., imminent storms).
